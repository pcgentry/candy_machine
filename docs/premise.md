# General Premise of the Candy Machine Project

[Document Home](./index.md)

The Candy Machine Project aims to create an environment that can simulate behaviors that model the real world. This is done in an imaginary environment so that the focus can be on methods of data science, such as the ML pipeline, collection of metrics about experiments, and general workflow.

Instead of just one simulation, many parallel simulations are run, and statistics on the outcomes are taken in the hopes of achieving some statistical validity to the findings.
