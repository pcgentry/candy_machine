The general premise of the project is that we are creating an environment that can simulate behaviors that might model the real world. We do this in an imaginary environment so that we can focus on our methods of data science. Our ML pipeline, our collection of metrics about experiments. Our general workflow.

When it comes to the simulation itself, rather than one single simulation, we run many parallel simulations and take statistics on the outcomes in the hopes of achieving some statistical validity to findings.
