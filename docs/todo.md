# TODO:


- revisit averages for graphs.. something is wrong there
- use precision in addition to accuracy
  - look into other available metrics
- Look at SKL2RiverClassifier for random forest, I'd like to see what RF can do with this, but it isn't implemented directly in River - https://riverml.xyz/latest/api/compat/SKL2RiverClassifier/
- Include Wuzzle.uuid in the training set. What if the tree actually needs to learn about individual wuzzles?
- might need to play with hunger rate so that the model has time to learn
- might also want to play with the candy death rate for the same reason


# ***Future Considerations***:

  What if CANDY was actually wuzzles in disguise?
  What if wuzzles and CANDY can have **babies**?
  CANDY might lay eggs in wuzzle poop. We're not sure about that yet.
  What if a wuzzle can form a psychic chat-bond with a CANDY, and as long as it persists, the effects are mutually beneficial?
  What if Wuzzles could recycle candy after a certain amount of time, or have a % chance of a candy getting reset. If so, is there a population density that perpetuates Wuzzledom?
