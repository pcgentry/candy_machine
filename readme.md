# The Problem Set

The planet Wuzzlopolis has two big problems.

# Problem 1: The planet is full of hungry wuzzles. 

Traditionally the Kind King of Wuzzlopolis would feed each wuzzle by hand based on how much he liked each wuzzle and what the Kind King thought they would like. 

This approach wasn't the best, because the Kind King was only one Wuzzle and had only one perspective. One wuzzle can only do so much, and he could never pay attention to every wuzzle and what they liked to eat... he had to make a lot of generalizations. 

Still, Wuzzlopolis did O.K. under the Kind King.

Unfortunately, **THE Kind King HAS DIED SUDDENLY** and there is nobody to replace them. There is nobody that can replace him, and we must build a machine to do his job.

We kind of low-key hope that it is even better at feeding Wuzzles than the Kind King.

# Problem 2: Wuzzlopolis is full of uneaten CANDY.

One interesting thing about CANDY on Wuzzlopolis is that it is alive. 

CANDY individuals also like to be eaten. In fact they need to be eaten because when they aren't, CANDY gets very **depressed and moody** and doesn't enjoy life very much. It also lays eggs in wuzzle poop and if a breed of CANDY isn't eaten enough, it eventually dies off.

CANDY comes in many flavors, ranging from **[ 'apple' : 'earwax' ]** and sometimes a single CANDY can have multiple flavors.

Luckily **WUZZLES EAT CANDY**, but are very picky about which flavors of candy they eat.

# It looks like we need to build a CANDY machine to feed wuzzles CANDY!

# Notes about the rules of Wuzzlopolis


- Every wuzzle has a set of flavors they can eat, but can't eat other flavors. ['peach', 'tarball', 'toe fuzz']
- If a wuzzle doesn't eat for 3 days, they die.
- If a CANDY individual isn't eaten for 3 days, they die.
- Every wuzzle has his own CANDY cookbook with lists sorted by CANDY breed where CANDY individuals can be listed. Our machine will pick CANDY individuals based on what CANDY individuals are on each CANDY list.
- Every wuzzle owns a lunchbox that can have up to 20 CANDY. Our machine will load the lunchbox from the cook book.
- When we say a wuzzle eats a candy, it actually just **licks** it and tosses it back into the wild. That wuzzle will never lick it again, but other wuzzles can lick the same candy.
