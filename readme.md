#The Problem Set

The planet Wuzzlopolis has two problems.

### Problem 1: The planet is full of hungry wuzzles. 

Traditionally the Kind King of Wuzzlopolis would feed each wuzzle by hand based on how much he liked each wuzzle and what the Kind King thought they would like. 

This approach wasn't the best, because the Kind King was only one Wuzzle and had only one perspective. One wuzzle can only do so much, and he could never pay attention to every wuzzle and what they liked to eat... he had to make a lot of generalizations. 

Still, Wuzzlopolis did O.K. under the Kind King.

Unfortunately, **THE Kind King HAS DIED SUDDENLY** and there is nobody to replace them. There is nobody that can replace him, and we must build a machine to do his job.

We kind of low-key hope that it is even better at feeding Wuzzles than the Kind King.

### Problem 2: Wuzzlopolis is full of uneaten CANDY.

One interesting thing about CANDY on Wuzzlopolis is that it is alive. 

CANDY also likes to be eaten. In fact it needs to be eaten because when it isn't, it gets very **depressed and moody** and doesn't enjoy life very much. It also lays its eggs in wuzzle poop and if a candy isn't eaten enough, it eventually dies off.

CANDY comes in many flavors, ranging from **[ 'apple' : 'earwax' ]** and sometimes a single CANDY can have multiple flavors.

Luckily **WUZZLES EAT CANDY**, but are very picky about which flavors of candy they eat.

So it looks like we need to build a CANDY machine to feed wuzzles CANDY.
